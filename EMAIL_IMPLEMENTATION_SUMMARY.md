## Technical Implementation

### Email Sending Process
1. **Admin creates staff member**
   - Backend creates user account
   - Verification email sent with token
   - Success message confirms verification email sent

2. **Staff member verifies email**
   - User clicks verification link
   - Account marked as verified
   - Welcome email sent with role-specific profile details
   - Success message confirms welcome email sent

3. **Both emails include proper error handling**

### Environment Configuration
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
MAIL_FROM=no-reply@medicare.local
APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Development vs Production

- **Production**: Sends real emails using configured SMTP
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if email service unavailable
